# 🚂 Deploy to Railway - Complete Guide

## ✅ What's Been Configured

Your app is **READY FOR RAILWAY** with:
- ✅ `railway.json` - Deployment configuration
- ✅ Build scripts - Automatic frontend build
- ✅ Production server - Serves React + API together
- ✅ Single deployment - One URL for everything!

---

## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

**Option A - NPM (Recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

**Option B - Use without installing:**
```bash
npx @railway/cli
```

**Option C - Mac with Homebrew:**
```bash
brew install railway
```

### Step 2: Login & Initialize

```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Go to your project
cd /Users/shaheersaud/MSAInventory

# Create new Railway project
railway init
```

When prompted:
- **Project name:** `msa-inventory` (or whatever you like)
- **Link to existing project?** No, create new

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

```bash
# Add all variables one by one
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production

railway variables set STORAGE_MODE=mongodb

railway variables set MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://ss4108_db_user:I7LTEA9LnANLfId9@cluster0.zk8wtbi.mongodb.net/msa-inventory?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

railway variables set JWT_SECRET="msa-inventory-2024-super-secret-key-for-production-use-only-change-this"

railway variables set JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

railway variables set PORT=3132
```

### Step 4: Deploy! 🚀

```bash
railway up
```

That's it! Railway will:
1. ✅ Install dependencies (client + server)
2. ✅ Build React frontend
3. ✅ Start Express server
4. ✅ Serve everything from ONE URL!

Wait ~3-5 minutes for first deployment.

---

## 🌐 Get Your Live URL

After deployment completes:

```bash
# Generate public URL
railway domain

# Or open in browser
railway open
```

Your app will be live at: `https://msa-inventory-production.up.railway.app` (or similar)

---

## 📋 Environment Variables Summary

Here's what we're setting:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Enables production mode |
| `STORAGE_MODE` | `mongodb` | Use MongoDB Atlas |
| `MONGODB_URI` | `mongodb+srv://...` | Your database connection |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `secret-key...` | JWT encryption |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | `7d` | Token expiry (7 days) |
| `PORT` | `3132` | Server port |

**Copy/Paste all at once:**
```bash
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production STORAGE_MODE=mongodb MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://ss4108_db_user:I7LTEA9LnANLfId9@cluster0.zk8wtbi.mongodb.net/msa-inventory?retryWrites=true&w=majority" JWT_SECRET="msa-inventory-2024-super-secret-key-for-production-use-only-change-this" JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d PORT=3132
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Whitelist Railway in MongoDB

Don't forget this step!

1. Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Click **"Network Access"**
3. Click **"+ ADD IP ADDRESS"**
4. Click **"ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE"**
5. Click **"Confirm"**

This allows Railway to connect to MongoDB.

---

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

### 1. Visit Your URL
```
https://your-app.railway.app
```

### 2. Try Quick Login
- Click **"Login as Admin"** (blue button)
- Should redirect to dashboard!

### 3. Check Logs
```bash
railway logs
```
Look for: `Server running on port 3132`

### 4. Test API
```
https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```
Should return JSON with server status.

### 5. Test Frontend
```
https://your-app.railway.app/dashboard
```
Should load dashboard (after login).

## 🎯 How It Works

### Single Deployment Architecture:

```
Railway Server
├── Build Phase
│   ├── Install server dependencies
│   ├── Install client dependencies
│   └── Build React → /client/build/
│
└── Runtime
    ├── Express server starts on PORT 3132
    ├── API routes: /api/* → Backend handlers
    └── All other routes: /* → React app (client/build/)
```

### Request Flow:

```
User visits: https://your-app.railway.app/

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Railway Server (Express)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  /api/items  → Backend API          │
│  /api/auth   → Backend API          │
│  /dashboard  → React App (index.html)│
│  /items      → React App (index.html)│
│  /           → React App (index.html)│
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**No CORS issues!** Everything is on the same domain! 🎉

## 🔧 Managing Your App

### Railway Dashboard

Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard

You can:
- ✅ View real-time logs
- ✅ Monitor CPU/Memory usage
- ✅ Add environment variables
- ✅ Add custom domains
- ✅ View deployments history
- ✅ Rollback to previous versions
- ✅ Scale resources

### Add Custom Domain

In Railway dashboard:
1. Click your project
2. Go to **"Settings"**
3. Click **"Domains"**
4. Add your domain (e.g., `inventory.msaexample.com`)
5. Update DNS records as shown
6. Done! ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?
```bash
railway logs
```
Common issues:
- Missing dependencies → Check package.json
- Build script error → Check client/package.json
- Out of memory → Upgrade Railway plan

### Can't Connect to Database?
1. Check MongoDB Atlas Network Access
2. Whitelist 0.0.0.0/0
3. Verify MONGODB_URI is correct
4. Check Railway logs for connection errors

### App Not Responding?
```bash
railway logs
```
Look for:
- `Server running on port 3132` ✅
- Any crash errors
- MongoDB connection status

### Quick Login Not Working?
Demo users might not exist yet!
1. Click "Register" on login page
2. Create first account
3. Go to MongoDB Atlas
4. Find your user in `users` collection
5. Change `role` to `"admin"`

### Port Issues?
Railway auto-assigns PORT. Our app reads it from `process.env.PORT`.
Don't hardcode ports!

### Environment Variable Not Working?
```bash
# Check if set correctly
railway variables

# Update if needed
railway variables set KEY=new-value

# Redeploy
railway up
```
